# Body

As a fan of the game (Dota 2) I created this project to follow and keep connected to the Dota2 tournaments. The main source is the oficial [Stream api](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI), starting from that I created a [web server](http://watcherd2.herokuapp.com/livegames) to manage the requests and included that [upcoming games](http://watcherd2.herokuapp.com/upcoming) and the done games, not present in the Stream api yet.
The goal of provide an app for a quick look of the games on going of dota 2.

This project use Carthage for manage the dependencies.

If you wanna contribute fell free to concat and fork the project
